# ResonantSystems — Hub README

This hub README collects and links repositories maintained under the ResonantSystems GitHub profile. It is intended to be added to a top-level "resonantsystems" repo or to the profile README to provide context links for visitors.

## Repositories of interest

- katana-cookie-blackhole — When Cookie Mismanagement Becomes a Platform Risk: Microsoft’s Katana Bug and the Support Black Hole
  - Topics: entra-id, owin, katana, cookie-bug, identity-flows, powershell
  - Public repo: https://github.com/ResonantSystems/katana-cookie-blackhole

## Purpose & Goals

ResonantSystems focuses on pragmatic tooling and documentation for identity flows, observability, and operational recovery patterns. The hub README provides a single place to:
- Surface investigative writeups and fixes (like katana-cookie-blackhole)
- Link tooling (scripts, snippets) and migration guidance
- Provide contact and collaboration instructions

## How to use this hub

- Follow links to repositories for details and actionable scripts.
- Open issues or PRs in the repo you want to change.
- For urgent support patterns (authentication loops, outage workarounds), see katana-cookie-blackhole.

## Next steps (you can do or ask me to do)
- Add this file to a profile or a dedicated "resonantsystems" repo as README.md.
- Create a "Pinned Repositories" section in your GitHub profile and pin katana-cookie-blackhole.
- Add a license file and contribution guidelines to each repo for community participation.
